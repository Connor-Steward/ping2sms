Alert System for PingPlotter Pro

# What is ping2sms?
ping2sms is a program I created to ensure our team was alerted 24/7 on any outages on our network. When using Pingplotter Pro,
if a network device or sensor goes offline an email is sent to preconfigured addresses. 

The issue? What if nobody is in the office or checking their emails? That's why I created ping2sms! When critical devices stop responding
to pings, ping2sms sends a text message SMS alert to everyone on the team. 

Our internal IT team used this system for ~6 months until we moved to another monitor system for other reasons.
